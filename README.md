GOAL: 

The goal of this project is simply to have fun with coding and to apply new things learned into the structure so that overtime the basic design takes upon itself a new life. 

Short term update: 

  * Add a number generator to introduce a teleporting mechanic that could hypothetically take the player from area to area to add variety to the flavor. 

Current bugs: 

  * At times the game will randomly crash upon reaching the end of the current build
